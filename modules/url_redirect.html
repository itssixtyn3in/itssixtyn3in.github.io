    <h1>Unexpected URL redirects</h1>
<p>Sometimes, Electron apps can get into trouble because they don't handle website addresses (URLs) properly. Imagine you're using an Electron app, and it doesn't do a good job of figuring out which web addresses are safe and which aren't. This can create a real mess. Bad guys can make fake web links that look totally safe to you, but when you click them, they take you to fake websites that try to trick you into giving away your private information. It's like thinking you're walking into a trusted store but ending up in a shady alley. These kinds of mistakes can be a big problem because they make you trust things that you shouldn't.</p>
