    <h1>Unexpected URL redirects</h1>
<p>Sometimes, Electron apps can get into trouble because they don't handle website addresses (URLs) properly. Imagine you're using an Electron app, and it doesn't do a good job of figuring out which web addresses are safe and which aren't. This can create a real mess.</p>
    <p>Bad guys can make fake web links that look totally safe to you, but when you click them, they take you to fake websites that try to trick you into giving away your private information. It's like thinking you're walking into a trusted store but ending up in a shady alley. These kinds of mistakes can be a big problem because they make you trust things that you shouldn't.</p>
<p>The real issue with these malicious redirects is how the application attempts to open URLs. If the application is set to open the link within the main frame, then users will mostly be unaware that any malicious action has occurred, because to them the application is already trusted on their machine. If the application behavior is properly configured, then a new external window will open to indicate that this is another external source outside of the application.</p>
<p>This lab has been designed to let you practice malicious redirects and see them in action. Post a link to https://itssixtyn3in.github.io/payloads/fake_phishing.html and then click on it. Pay close attention to the target behavior of the link and notice how the main frame is redirected. You can also see the difference by custom a link using anchor tags with the directive target=_blank</p>
