    <h1>RCE through Protocol Handlers</h1>
<p>Let's talk about protocol handlers in Electron apps and why they can present a big danger. Native protocol handlers on a Windows machine are components of the operating system that allow it to understand and interact with specific protocols or URL schemes. These handlers enable Windows to open or execute applications or perform actions when certain protocol or URL patterns are encountered. They're like little helpers that can open web links in the default browser, which is pretty convenient. But here's the catch: if these handlers aren't guarded properly, they can become a hacker's playground.</p>
    <p>Imagine you click on a link within an Electron app, and it's supposed to open a web page. If that link isn't shielded, a sneaky attacker can craft it to do more than just open a pageâ€”they can execute malicious code on your computer. This is what we call Remote Code Execution (RCE), and it's bad news. Essentially, an attacker tricks the app into running their own code, potentially taking control of your system.</p>
    <p>Modern browsers usually protect against these kinds of attacks by displaying a prompt to the user that has to be confirmed before the application launches, however the Electron framework handles protocol handlers a bit different. When you click on a protocol handler in an Electron app, then the command is passed to shell.openExternal which will attempt to launch the application without any security prompts. The Electron team actually published a section in their security guide that provides a warning to not allow shell.OpenExternal links without properly validating the information that a user can enter into fields (https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#15-do-not-use-shellopenexternal-with-untrusted-content)</p> 
    <p>So, protecting those protocol handlers is a must to keep Electron apps safe and secure.</p>
