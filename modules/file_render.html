    <h1>Unexpected redirect through document rendering</h1>
<p>Imagine using an Electron app, and you click on a link that's supposed to open a webpage. However, because of misconfigurations, that link doesn't open in a separate web browser as expected. Instead, it opens within the app itself, making it appear safe and legitimate. This situation can be exploited by cybercriminals to lead users to phishing pages designed to trick them into revealing personal information, like usernames and passwords. Users trust the app's interface, so they're more likely to fall for these tricks, thinking they're on a secure website. It's crucial for Electron app developers to get link settings right to prevent these misleading and potentially dangerous situations. </p>
<p>In this particular scenario, the developers have taken a precautionary approach by completely prohibiting URLs on the page to prevent potential issues. However, an unexpected link redirection problem can still creep into the application through the inclusion of external content, such as PDF or Word documents. These documents may contain links within them, and the way these documents are displayed can be governed by specific rules within Electron applications, depending on the underlying libraries in use. Consequently, this introduces the possibility of misconfigurations because it's a use case that may not have been thoroughly considered by the developers</p>
