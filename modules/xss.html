    <h1>XSS execution in Electron</h1>
<p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities pose unique and heightened risks in Electron applications compared to traditional websites due to the nature of Electron apps. Keep in mind that Electron is  a framework for building desktop applications using web technologies, but the web content is rendered within a native application window.</p>
<p>Understanding where the XSS payload is executed from will give you an important insight on how much you can escalate the vulnerability within the framework. If the payload is executed within the application itself and other misconfigurations are overlooked, then Electron based XSS can reveal additional attack surfaces like:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Local File System Access:</b> In Electron, web content often has direct access to the local file system, which can include sensitive user data, configurations, or system resources. </li>
<li><b>Native API Exposure:</b> Electron apps can utilize native APIs and modules to access system-level functionality, such as the file system, hardware devices, or network interfaces.</li>
<li><b>No Same-Origin Policy:</b> Traditional web browsers enforce the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts web pages from making requests to domains other than their own. In Electron apps, this policy is often relaxed, making it easier for an attacker to send malicious requests to external servers, steal sensitive data, or perform actions on behalf of the user.</li>
<li><b>Bypassing Web Security Features:</b> Electron apps may disable or customize certain web security features that are typically enforced by web browsers. This can open up users to exploits that they would usually be protected by through native browser features.</li>
<li><b>Complex Attack Surface:</b> Electron applications combine web technologies with native code, resulting in a larger and more complex attack surface. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities not only in the web content but also in the Electron framework itself, potentially gaining deeper access and control over the application and the host system.</li>
<li><b>Increased Trust:</b> Users tend to trust desktop applications more than websites, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks. </li>
</ul>
<p>This lab has been created to introduce you to spot the difference between executing XSS payloads in a desktop application vs the website. This page allows you to post comments, but the site is also vulnerable to XSS payloads that allow you to take unintended actions. If you use a common XSS payload in this application vs the website, then you will notice that the payload is actually executed by the application itself. </p>
