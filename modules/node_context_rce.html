    <h1>Node Integration and Context Isolation RCE</h1>
<p>Imagine Node integration as a tool that allows Electron apps to tap into the power of server-side JavaScript within the app itself. It's like having a supercharged engine under the hood. But here's the catch: when Node integration is combined with disabled context isolation, it can create a security nightmare. Users can innocently include links to external websites that have hidden malicious scripts. These scripts, thanks to the absence of context isolation, get free rein within the app and even the user's computer. It's like inviting a stranger into your house, thinking they're harmless, only to realize they have the keys to your entire home. This setup blurs the lines between web content and the app's inner workings, giving external scripts unprecedented access to the computer's resources. It's a recipe for disaster, potentially leading to major security breaches, as attackers can run their own code and potentially take control of the user's deviceâ€”all through links that users click on, thinking they're safe.</p>
